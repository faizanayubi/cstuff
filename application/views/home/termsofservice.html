                <p>
                    4.2. Service Level Agreement. Our current Service Level Agreement (SA) is as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                    (a) UNMANAGED SERVICES ONLY. Our 24 hour on site staff will respond to tickets regarding server hardware and service disruption issues only on a first
                    come, first served basis. Clients are required to manage their own data backups and all software aspects of the server including operating system
                    configuration beyond a base OS install.

                    infrastructure.

                <p>

                <p>
                    (e) Disruptions caused by planned or unplanned maintenance are not covered by this SA.

                <p>
                    (g) In the event that there is an unplanned Service disruption, you may open a support ticket and request an Account credit to be issued for a prorated
                    amount of your monthly invoice amount equal to the time of the Service disruption. For example: If you pay $60 per month for your server and it is
                    unavailable for 24 hours (during a 30 day month) due to an unplanned service outage, you may request an account credit for $2. You understand that this is
                    your sole remedy for an unplanned service outage.
                </p>

                    check the monthly renewal date on your invoice to confirm when it is due.

                    Date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (c) All invoices are emailed and are available in your Account panel. Invoices are not sent via postal mail, PDF, fax or any other method other than email.
                    We do not contact customers via phone to discuss billing issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (d) If your payment is declined or you fail to submit payment on or before the invoice due date, your Service will be disconnected/suspended at midnight

                <p>
                    (e) A billing dispute of any kind does not exempt you from paying current and future bills. Billing disputes resolved in the customer's favor will receive
                    account credit for overpayment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (f) If any chargebacks occur on your credit card or PayPal account we reserve the right to terminate all Service and recycle your server(s) without notice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (g) Failure to make payment within 48 hours of the time we disconnect/suspend your Service will result in your Service being terminated and a termination

                </p>
                <p>

                    8.1 We will suspend your right to access or use any portion or all of your Service and disconnect your server immediately if we determine:

                    (b) For Cause Termination. Either party may terminate this Agreement for cause if there is a breach of this Agreement by the other party. We may terminate
                    this Agreement immediately if any act or omission by you results in a suspension. Your failure to make payment within 48 hours of the time we
                    disconnect/suspend your Service will result in your Service being terminated and a termination fee of $10 will be assessed against your Account. SERVICE
                    TERMINATION IMMEDIATELY ERASES YOUR DATA AND YOUR DATA IS NOT RECOVERABLE. We may also terminate if our relationship with a provider of software or
                    technology we use to provide the Service Offerings expires or changes; or if we believe providing the Services could create a financial or technical burden
                    or a security risk for us; or in order to comply with the law or requests of governmental entities; or if we determine any Service Offering has become
                    impractical for any reason.

                    (b) Post-Termination Assistance. Any post-termination assistance from us is in our sole discretion and subject to our agreement in writing from a manager.
                    Communications from our customer service representatives through the ticketing system do not constitute our agreement to any post termination assistance.
                    Termination erases all of Your Content and, as such,<a name="_GoBack"></a> we are unable to assist in retrieving any lost data; and you will be unable to
                    retrieve Your Content from the Services.

                    10.2 Service Offerings License. As between you and us, we own and reserve all right, title, and interest in and to the Service Offerings. We grant you a
                    limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferrable license to do the following during the Term: (i) access and use the Services solely in accordance with
                    this Agreement.

                    11. INDEMNIFICATION
                </p>
                <p>
                    11.1. You will defend, indemnify, protect and hold harmless us and our employees, officers, directors, members or shareholders, lenders, principals,
                    managers and representatives from and against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees
                    regardless of whether any action is ever commenced) arising out of or relating to any third party claim, suit, action or proceeding brought against us
                    concerning: (a) your use of the Service Offerings (including any activities under your account and use by your employees and personnel); (b) breach of this
                    Agreement or violation of applicable law, rule or regulation by you; (c) your content or processes, including any claim involving alleged infringement or
                    misappropriation of third-party rights by the use or marketing of Your Content; (d) a dispute between you and any End User; (e) any negligent or willful
                    act or omission by you; (f) any damages arising out of the Service Offerings or failure of Service Offerings; or (g) the destruction or loss or damage of
                    your data. If we are obligated to respond to a third party subpoena, order or process described above, you agree to reimburse us for reasonable attorneys’

                    These obligations survive termination of your relationship with WII or your use of our Service or Site. WII reserves the right to assume the defense and
                    control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate with WII in asserting any available defenses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    11.2. Process. We will notify you of any claim subject to Section 11.1, but our failure to immediately notify you will only affect your obligations under
                    Section 11.1 to the extent that our failure prejudices your ability to defend the claim. You may use counsel of your own choosing (subject to our written
                    consent) to defend against a claim or to settle a claim, provided that you obtain our prior written consent. You agree that we may assume control of the
                    defense and settlement process at any time.

                </p>
                <p>
                    APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE, SO THIS
                    LIMITATION OF LIABILITY MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IF ANY PART OF THIS LIMITATION ON LIABILITY IS FOUND TO BE INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE FOR ANY REASON, THEN THE
                    AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF WII UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES FOR LIABILITIES THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN LIMITED SHALL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100). IF
                    YOU DO NOT AGREE, YOUR SOLE REMEDY FOR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE SERVICE OR SITE IS TO STOP USING THE SITE AND/OR THOSE SERVICES.

                    portion will be severed from this Agreement but the rest of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect.
